# covid_malaria

Hi in this solution I have tried to solve dieses prediction problem with different machine/deep learning methods.
  Models I have used <br />
  1. Random Forest Classifier <br />
  2. Logistic Regression <br />
  3. DL Model <br />  <br />


These are the simplest and most effective models to predict values based on old data. <br />

Note: As I do not have Malaria data so I just divided Covid into 4 types : MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, and NONE.
In case we have malaria data I can just replace those 4 with covid and malaria only.
